# cproject

Since I've started with programming, I choose C as my main programming language. There is a lot of contents 
about this language that's a addicted thing until thosedays.

You can find here little projects as beginner, but the main goal is the full deploy of all "C How to program" book
content and exercises. If you already read this book and take some time to look at deeply, you can imagine how hard
it is. I'm not talking about the problem solved, but to reach the end of this book.

I'll keep it up with it, and maybe, hope that I could make Dennis Ritchie proud (RIP).
